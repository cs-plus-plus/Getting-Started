# Introduction to Git, GitHub, JUnit, Maven, GitHub Classroom, and GitHub Desktop

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system that tracks changes in code and files. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project efficiently and helps manage code history, branches, and merges.

### Key Features of Git
- **Version Control**: Tracks changes in files, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed. Provides a clear history of who made changes, what changes were made, and when.
- **Branching and Merging**: Branches allow you to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Merging integrates changes from different branches, enabling collaborative development.
- **Commit and Push**: A commit saves your changes locally with a message describing what was done. Push sends your commits to a remote repository, like GitHub, for others to access.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides tools for version control, collaboration, and project management, allowing developers to share code, contribute to open-source projects, and work together on private or public repositories.

### Core Features of GitHub
- **Repositories**: Central location for all your project files and history.
- **Pull Requests**: A way to propose changes to a project; allows for code review and discussion before merging.
- **Issues and Project Boards**: Tools for tracking bugs, feature requests, and project tasks.

## What is Maven?

Maven is a build automation and project management tool primarily used for Java projects. It helps manage project dependencies, build lifecycle, and documentation, simplifying the build process and project setup.

### Key Features of Maven
- **Dependency Management**: Automatically downloads required libraries and dependencies from a central repository and handles version conflicts.
- **Project Structure and Build Lifecycle**: Enforces a standard project layout and manages the complete build lifecycle, including compiling, testing, packaging, and deploying.
- **Plugins**: Uses plugins to perform tasks such as compiling code, testing, packaging, and deploying applications.

## What is JUnit?

JUnit is a popular testing framework for Java. It is used for writing and running repeatable automated tests, helping ensure that code behaves as expected by validating the correctness of the code through tests.

### Key Features of JUnit
- **Annotations**: 
  - `@Test`: Marks a method as a test case.
  - `@Before`: Executes code before each test (setup).
  - `@After`: Executes code after each test (cleanup).
- **Assertions**:
  - `assertEquals(expected, actual)`: Checks if two values are equal.
  - `assertTrue(condition)`: Checks if a condition is true.
  - `assertNull(object)`: Checks if an object is null.

## Benefits of Git, GitHub, Maven, and JUnit in High School Computer Science Classes

- **Encourages Collaboration**: Students can work together on projects, learning how to manage code contributions from multiple people.
- **Introduces Real-World Tools and Practices**: Familiarizes students with industry-standard tools and concepts of build automation, version control, and testing.
- **Supports Learning and Problem Solving**: Provides a platform to explore open-source projects and contribute, enhancing learning through real-world applications.

## GitHub Classroom and GitHub Desktop

### GitHub Classroom
- A tool designed to help educators manage coding assignments using GitHub.
- Simplifies distribution, collection, and grading of student code.
- Automatically sets up repositories for each student or group and integrates with GitHub's version control features.

### GitHub Desktop
- A user-friendly application for managing Git repositories locally without using the command line.
- Provides a visual interface for common Git tasks like committing, branching, merging, and pushing changes.
- Helps beginners and those unfamiliar with Git commands manage projects easily.
